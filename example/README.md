# example

An XMTP example app.

> **Important**  
> The example app includes a demonstration of how you might approach caching, or offline storage. Be aware that the example app naively performs a full refresh very frequently, **which causes slowdowns**. The underlying `xmtp-flutter` client SDK itself has no performance issues. If you want to provide offline storage in your app, be sure to design your refresh strategies with app performance in mind. Future versions of the example app aim to make this aspect easier to manage.
